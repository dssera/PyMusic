Hi, it's my first full(I hope) project on django framework.
It is a simple music app where you can add music from share playlist to your own music list
Also you can create playlists that consist of music in your music list

The purpose of this project is to make first full and usable project affecting all stages of development  
Good luck for me:)  


Day 1:
Set up a project, virtual environment, etc. Made registration, authorization.
I also figured out how to work with audio files (I thought it would cause more problems)

In general, all my decisions are very trivial now. But more important thing is practice.

Day 2:
Today I haven't done as much as yesterday, but I did smth.
This smth is - Began to make user's music page and adding/removing music to user's main playlist

I spend mush time solving easy problems because i face them for the first time.
And because of this progress is really slow
